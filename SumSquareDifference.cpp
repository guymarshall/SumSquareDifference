// The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
//     1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

// The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
//     (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 3025

// Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
//     3025 - 385 = 2640

// Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
